simple SQL database server

This is a basic relational database server I am making for fun - hence, the
name. FunDB...

 * Runs as a server, and accepts connections from many clients
 * Is designed for highly concurrent reads and writes
 * Is implemented in Go.

You almost certainly want to use a different DB server for your
application - postgres, mysql, sqlite3, etc.  The only reason to look
at this is if you are learning Go, or like the language, and would
enjoy learning from my code (and/or learning from its flaws).
